# Subset Sum and Traveling Salesman Problems

This repository contains two Python implementations of classic computer science problems:

## 1. Subset Sum Problem

The file `backtracking_recursive_approach_subset_sum_problem.py` contains a recursive implementation of the Subset Sum Problem. The goal is to print all subsets of a given set whose sum is equal to a given target sum.

### Usage
python backtracking_recursive_approach_subset_sum_problem.py


## 2. Traveling Salesman Problem

The file naive_implementation_traveling_salesman_problem.py implements a naive solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem. In this problem, the salesman must find the shortest path that allows him to visit all given cities exactly once and return to the starting city.

### Usage
'''python
python naive_implementation_traveling_salesman_problem.py
'''
## How to Run the scripts

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can run each script using the command python <script_name>.py.
We have also, a collab is here, then you can directly execute them !
